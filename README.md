Open Ai Health Chat

-- Overview
    Open ai health chat allows the user to input questions about health issues and other health 
    related topics. This is possible through the Open Ai Api that is integrated in the back end.
    Once a user input a question, a response is sent back from the Open Ai and provides an answer.
    If there is an error, an alert is sent to the front end to notify the user than an error has 
    occured.
